Goal

I will use variables in iris dataset to predict species information by machine learning. This goal can be achieved by building a shiny interface which allow the user to choose variables and prediction model.
Ideas

Users can choose at least 2 variables from the 4 variables of iris dataset as well as the a model-random forest or rpart. The server will take the users' input and apply it to machine learning. It will return the selected data and the confusion matrix of prediction.
